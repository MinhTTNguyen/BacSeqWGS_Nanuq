Please note: the KBase-derived GenBank file for annotated genome objects currently only shows "gene" features. CDS and mRNA feature types are not currently included in the GenBank download, but are in the KBase Genome object. We hope to address this issue in the future.

This directory includes the KBase-derived GenBank file and also (if you originally uploaded the genome from an annotated GenBank file) the original GenBank input.
